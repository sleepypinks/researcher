## Overview

What makes design invisible? Make it good.

This project steps in a user's shoes on what goes on when users try to use a chat room. I observe users interactions with a [public chatroom](http://chatatbrownhci.herokuapp.com), what are users thinking when they interact with the interface and how do they behave. How does the interface make them "feel"? We combine these thoughts, feelings and behaviors and create three personas and one storyboard.
