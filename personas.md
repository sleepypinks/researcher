## Overview

What makes design invisible? Make it good.

This project steps in a user's shoes on what goes on when users try to use a chat room. I observe users interactions with a [public chatroom](http://chatatbrownhci.herokuapp.com), what are users thinking when they interact with the interface and how do they behave. How does the interface make them "feel"? We combine these thoughts, feelings and behaviors and create three personas and one storyboard.


## Research Question

Messages are annoying, frustrating and stressful. Those ... while we wait for our friend's message can induce stress, anxiety and apprehension. To better cater to these pesky feelings, a new chatroom is designed where users can see the message "on the go".
