# Persona
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SleepyPinks. I aspire to create meaningful impact through design. I'm a busy person who has 4-hour long morning classes. I am taking UI/UX and for my assignments, I'm a tad bit inefficient at html programming which is why I am using github pages to make my portfolio :)

# Storyboard 
1. Forked the static design from https://github.com/ankitsultana/researcher
2. Updated url parameters in _config.yml_
3. Add md repository for the first assignment (personas and storyboarding).
