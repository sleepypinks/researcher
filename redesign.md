# Overview: Live Typing Interface

Messages are annoying, frustrating and stressful. Those ... while we wait for our friend's message can induce stress, anxiety and apprehension. To better cater to these pesky feelings, a new chatroom is designed where users can see the message "on the go".

But, wait a second. That sign up page is not the best based on HCI's usability and accessibility standards. This page does not work for visually impaired, people with low vision, and probably does not even for an average user as well. That dark color combinations, hmm. It also is not informative and memorable. The title says "Welcome to Brown HCI Research Study" - that's vague and anyone coming back to it would not remember what the study or interface was about.

# Usability Problems

_Excuse me, what did you say about my website?_ Angry Amy... is angry. She heard us talking about her website and has questions why we think its problematic. This is understandable, so let's walk Amy through some of the issues with the webpage.

• Memorability: The webpage scores good for memorability when it comes to input elements. All elements have a an appropriate placeholder which can help users to remember which credentials go where. However, the title of the website is **vague**. What is the purpose of this website? What kind of research is this website tied with? The current webpage in itself is not memorable for a user who would like to use this website after some months.

• Learnability: First-use learnability for novice users is not **user-friendly**. If someone, who does not have their login credentials yet, browse this website, they have no idea what to do (where do they sign up, who do they contact) in that case.

• Efficiency: Built on the point above, the web page holds good that it does not distract and serves for only log in purposes, but is **not designed efficiently** for _first time users_ or _someone who forgot their credentials_. Users might do trial and errors for extended period of time which could have been saved by having `Sign Up` or `Forgotten Credentials` options!
