# Real Time Texting (Live Typing) - an Overview

Despite its popularity and convenience, **messaging consists of many similar limitations** as other computer-mediated communication (CMC) technology. One limitation of messaging is its [lack of social cues](). Social cues play a significant role in conversations as they influence a user’s perceived social presence, enjoyment, and usage intentions.

To enhance users’ perceived social presence, [is-typing indicator]() was introduced in instant messaging (IM) applications to support awareness of co-presence in real-time. The indicator, which **shows three moving dots (...)** or displays the message **_Person A is typing)_** was implemented for CMC systems to facilitate awareness by providing cues that the other person is typing. However, users can feel stresses and anxious while waiting for a message response and seeing three dots (...) for an extended period of time!

In this research project, we design a new interface that displays message as the user is writing it. That is, all messages would be shown [in real time]!! Real-time text (RTT) is [text transmitted instantly as it is typed or created](). **Recipients can immediately read the message while it is being written, without waiting.** RTT, or real-time text, sends text messages immediately as you type them, without requiring users to hit send.
