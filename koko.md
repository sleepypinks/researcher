# Koko - an Overview

Koko is a startup that [integrates mental health resources in pre-existing social media platforms to provide younger adults an easier access point to mental health care]().  They partner with online communities to help find and treat at-risk individuals directly on their platform using online interventions on Koko. They use a keyword-trigger design system in which certain negative-thought-keywords will trigger the interface to open up resources for mental health. In this design process, we are creating a plug-in feature linked to a Koko mobile app. 

# Designing Koko
A mobile app format was chosen because many personal conversations for young adolescents and adults happen on phones and messaging apps. In comparison, laptops and desktops may be used just for working purposes. The simple plug-in features would transition better on the phone because it is a simple screen change. 

This Koko mobile app includes a diverse set of features such as [color therapy](), [online consulting](), and also [virtual pet therapy]() powered by cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). We added diversified features and access points to therapy because we recognize individuals may require different types of help and that a one-size-fit-all approach may not work for everyone. In particular, we think that color therapy would be a good form of distracting users visually, online consulting is good for users who want to verbally express themselves, and therapy with a virtual pet therapy may be good for users who want to feel more social contact or need behavioral adjustments for distraction. These diverse activities can help users redirect not only their thoughts but also their online behavior in a more positive direction when using other websites.

# Low-Fidelity Prototype

After planning Koko's functionalities, the next thing, in our journey, is to create some sketches, also called lo-fidelity prototypes. Below we have sketched how we can design Koko.
