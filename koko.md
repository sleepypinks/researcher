# Koko - an Overview

Koko is a startup that [integrates mental health resources in pre-existing social media platforms to provide younger adults an easier access point to mental health care]().  They partner with online communities to help find and treat at-risk individuals directly on their platform using online interventions on Koko. They use a keyword-trigger design system in which certain negative-thought-keywords will trigger the interface to open up resources for mental health. In this design process, we are creating a plug-in feature linked to a Koko mobile app. 

# Designing Koko
A mobile app format was chosen because many personal conversations for young adolescents and adults happen on phones and messaging apps. In comparison, laptops and desktops may be used just for working purposes. The simple plug-in features would transition better on the phone because it is a simple screen change. 

This Koko mobile app includes a diverse set of features such as [color therapy](), [online consulting](), and also [virtual pet therapy]() powered by cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). We added diversified features and access points to therapy because we recognize individuals may require different types of help and that a one-size-fit-all approach may not work for everyone. In particular, we think that color therapy would be a good form of distracting users visually, online consulting is good for users who want to verbally express themselves, and therapy with a virtual pet therapy may be good for users who want to feel more social contact or need behavioral adjustments for distraction. These diverse activities can help users redirect not only their thoughts but also their online behavior in a more positive direction when using other websites.

# Sketch it Out
After planning Koko's functionalities, the next thing, in our journey, was to create some sketches - what does Koko mean for each user? All of us decided to brainstorm what does accessible mental health entail and how can we design an application for users with different needs. Below we present the initial sketches (individual brainstorming sessions) where each user [designed their own version of Koko](). You can differentiate between the versions by the title (Design Alternative #).

# Low-Fidelity Prototype

Although we had some ideas for Koko, our intuiton behind the features differed. Accessible mental health can be seen as all - an umbrella for multiple options! Some people want to explore their feelings through color and pet therapy while some would like to talk their feelings out. Which is why, we [combined the sketches to present one design framework for Koko]() that tries to satisfy different user needs.

# Hi-Fidelity Prototype

Next, we present the hi fidelity prototypes for Koko. In this stage, we decided on the vidual design guideline (color scheme, typography, hierarchy, interaction states) and the flow of the application. We chose [green as our primary color] as it's linked to calmer aura. Since we designed for a mobile platform, we kept the elements minimal and simplistic to avoid overwhelming the user.

# Hi-Fidelity Prototype: Feedback Incorporated

After the design team has iterated over the mockup internally, the hi-fi prototypes were presented in front of other stakholders to receive feedback. Koko's initial mockup was [praised for simplistic and interactive elements (the sushi and the cat](), however, [users were concerned with the design's navigation and color scheme](). Below we have annotated the comments received from our stakeholders and our actions to incorporate that in our design.
