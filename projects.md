# Research Projects
üëã Here you can find a list of my research projects. Since I am a researcher, each of my project is provided with a **context**, **research question**, **process method to explore those questions**, and **lessons learned**. Happy navigating! :)

## [**Real-time texting - Design Strategies from a Pilot Study**](https://sleepypinks.github.io/livetyping)

![cheese](images/texting.jpeg)

Messages are annoying, frustrating and stressful. Those three dots‚Ä¶ while we wait for our friend‚Äôs message can induce stress, anxiety and apprehension. To better cater to the lack of nonverbal cues, a new chatroom is designed where users can see the message ‚Äúon the go‚Äù. We conducted a pilot study to **brainstorm design strategies** to increase presence in messaging. [[project]](https://sleepypinks.github.io/livetyping)

## [**Exploring real-time text interface through personas and story-boarding**](https://sleepypinks.github.io/personas)

![confuse2.png](images/confuse2.png)

In this research project, we design a new interface that displays message as the user is writing it. That is, all messages would be shown [in real time]!! Real-time text (RTT) is text transmitted instantly as it is typed or created. By observing and **interviewing real users** interacting with our real time texting website, we created personas based on these users. We then illustrate a storyboard for one of our personas.

## [**Redesigning texting interfaces for responsiveness**](https://sleepypinks.github.io/redesign)

![desktop.jpeg](images/desktop.jpeg)

By **identifying flaws** in an our real time texting interface, we created low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for various screen sizes, and build a responsive website based on those prototypes. In this study, we design our research project page according to the principles of UX design. [[project]](https://sleepypinks.github.io/redesign)

## [**Koko - Increasing social support and accessibility in mental health**](https://sleepypinks.github.io/koko)
![/peer_support](images//peersupport.jpeg)

We take a step back from designing messages for richer communication. In this project, we iteratively **designed an application** for a mental health startup. Koko is a startup that integrates mental health resources in pre-existing social media platforms to provide younger adults an easier access point to mental health care. They partner with online communities to help find and treat at-risk individuals directly on their platform using online interventions on Koko. [[project]](https://sleepypinks.github.io/koko)
