# Research Projects
üëã Here you can find a list of my research projects. Since I am a researcher, each of my project is provided with a **context**, **research question**, **process method to explore those questions**, and **lessons learned**. Happy navigating! :)

## [**Real-time texting - Design Strategies from a Pilot Study**]() [[project]](https://sleepypinks.github.io/livetyping)

Messages are annoying, frustrating and stressful. Those three dots‚Ä¶ while we wait for our friend‚Äôs message can induce stress, anxiety and apprehension. To better cater to the lack of nonverbal cues, a new chatroom is designed where users can see the message ‚Äúon the go‚Äù. We conducted a pilot study to **brainstorm design strategies** to increase presence in messaging.
