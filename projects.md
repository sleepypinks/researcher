## [**Real-time texting - Design Strategies from a Pilot Study**]()[website](https://sleepypinks.github.io/livetyping)

Messages are annoying, frustrating and stressful. Those three dots… while we wait for our friend’s message can induce stress, anxiety and apprehension. To better cater to the lack of nonverbal cues, a new chatroom is designed where users can see the message “on the go”. We conducted a pilot study to **brainstorm design strategies** to increase presence in messaging.
