# About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="images/1599155795154.jpeg">

üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @SleepyPinks. I aspire to **create meaningful impact through design*. I am a grad student in the [Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Lab](https://hci.brown.edu/) at Brown University. Before joining Brown, I worked on the intersection of design and technology to improve the psychological and educational impact of everyday tech.

> Designing for marganised communities who are overlooked by the Design community.

# Research Interests

My research focuses on designing accessible social support healthcare applications. I use mixed methods research in my work, including interviews, ethnography observations, grounded theory and surveys. Currently, I am researching on ways to convey social and nonverbal cues in messaging application. 

Before coming to Brown, I designeded novel applications to address the needs of Pakistan‚Äôs marganalized communities (e.g. people with lived experience, low-literate populations, visually impaired, and neuro-divergent children).

# Projects

## [**Real-time texting - Design Strategies from a Pilot Study**](https://sleepypinks.github.io/livetyping)

![cheese](images/texting.jpeg)

Messages are annoying, frustrating and stressful. Those three dots‚Ä¶ while we wait for our friend‚Äôs message can induce stress, anxiety and apprehension. To better cater to the lack of nonverbal cues, a new chatroom is designed where users can see the message ‚Äúon the go‚Äù. We conducted a pilot study to **brainstorm design strategies** to increase presence in messaging.

## [**Exploring real-time text interface through personas and story-boarding**](https://sleepypinks.github.io/personas)

![confuse2.png](images/confuse2.png)

By observing and **interviewing real users** interacting with our real time texting website, we created personas based on these users. We then illustrate a storyboard for one of our personas.

## [**Redesigning texting interfaces for responsiveness**](https://sleepypinks.github.io/redesign)

![desktop.jpeg](images/desktop.jpeg)

By **identifying flaws** in an our real time texting interface, we created low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for various screen sizes, and build a responsive website based on those prototypes.
