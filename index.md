# About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="images/1599155795154.jpeg">

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SleepyPinks. I aspire to create meaningful impact through design. I am a grad student in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at Brown University, where I am advised by Prof. Jeff Huang. Before joining Brown, I worked on the intersection of design and technology to improve the psychological and educational impact of everyday tech.

# Research Interests

My research focuses on designing accessible social support healthcare applications. I use mixed methods research in my work, including interviews, ethnography observations, grounded theory and surveys. Currently, I am analysing design to increase the richness of text-based platforms.
