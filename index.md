## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="images/1599155795154.jpeg">

👋 Hi, I’m @SleepyPinks. I aspire to create meaningful impact through design. I'm a busy person who has 4-hour long morning classes. I am taking UI/UX and for my assignments, I'm a tad bit inefficient at html programming. Whenever, I try to make my website from scratch, I get stuck in debugging 🐛 that makes me sleepy. This is why I am using github pages to make my portfolio :)


> It’s not ‘us versus them’ or even ‘us on behalf of them.’ For a design thinker it has to be ‘us with them'
