# About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="images/1599155795154.jpeg">

üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @SleepyPinks. I aspire to create meaningful impact through design. I am a grad student in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at Brown University, where I am advised by Prof. Jeff Huang. Before joining Brown, I worked on the intersection of design and technology to improve the psychological and educational impact of everyday tech.

# Research Interests

My research focuses on designing accessible social support healthcare applications. I use mixed methods research in my work, including interviews, ethnography observations, grounded theory and surveys. Currently, I am analysing design to increase the richness of text-based platforms.

> It‚Äôs not ‚Äòus versus them‚Äô or even ‚Äòus on behalf of them.‚Äô For a design thinker it has to be ‚Äòus with them'

Messages are annoying, frustrating and stressful. Those ‚Ä¶ while we wait for our friend‚Äôs message can induce stress, anxiety and apprehension. To better cater to these pesky feelings, a new chatroom is designed where users can see the message ‚Äúon the go‚Äù. We conducted a pilot study to **brainstorm design strategies** to increase presence in messaging.
