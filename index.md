# About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="images/1599155795154.jpeg">

üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @SleepyPinks. I aspire to create meaningful impact through design. I am a grad student in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at Brown University, where I am advised by Prof. Jeff Huang. Before joining Brown, I worked on the intersection of design and technology to improve the psychological and educational impact of everyday tech.

# Research Interests

My research focuses on designing accessible social support healthcare applications. I use mixed methods research in my work, including interviews, ethnography observations, grounded theory and surveys. Currently, I am analysing design to increase the richness of text-based platforms.

# Projects

* [**Real time texting - Design Strategies from a Pilot Study**](https://sleepypinks.github.io/userstudy)

*Role: UX Researcher*

Messages are annoying, frustrating and stressful. Those ‚Ä¶ while we wait for our friend‚Äôs message can induce stress, anxiety and apprehension. To better cater to these pesky feelings, a new chatroom is designed where users can see the message ‚Äúon the go‚Äù. We conducted a pilot study to **brainstorm design strategies** to increase presence in messaging.

We observing and **interviewing real users** interacting with our Real time texting website, and create personas based on these users. We then illustrate a storyboard for one of our personas.

*Role: UX Designer*

By **identifying flaws** in an our real time texting interface, we created low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for various screen sizes, and build a responsive website based on those prototypes.

* [**Koko - Increasing social support and accessibility in mental health**](https://sleepypinks.github.io/koko)
