# About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="images/1599155795154.jpeg">

üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @SleepyPinks. I aspire to **create meaningful impact through design*. I am a grad student in the [Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Lab](https://hci.brown.edu/) at Brown University. Before joining Brown, I worked on the intersection of design and technology to improve the psychological and educational impact of everyday tech.

> [Creating Meaningful Impact through Design]()

My research focuses on [designing accessible social support healthcare applications]. I use mixed methods research in my work, including interviews, ethnography observations, grounded theory and surveys. Currently, I am **researching on ways to convey social and nonverbal cues in messaging applications**. Before coming to Brown, I designed novel applications to address the needs of Pakistan‚Äôs marganalized communities.

# Research Projects

**Real-time texting - Design Strategies from a Pilot Study:** To better cater to the lack of nonverbal cues, a new chatroom is designed where users can see the message ‚Äúon the go‚Äù. We conducted a pilot study to [brainstorm design strategies]() to increase presence in messaging. [[project]](https://sleepypinks.github.io/livetyping)

**Exploring real-time text interface through personas and story-boarding:** By observing and [interviewing real users]() interacting with our real time texting website, we created personas based on these users. We then illustrate a storyboard for one of our personas. [[project]](https://sleepypinks.github.io/personas)

**Redesigning texting interfaces for responsiveness:**] By [identifying flaws]() in an our real time texting interface, we created low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for various screen sizes, and build a responsive website based on those prototypes.

**Koko - Increasing social support and accessibility in mental health:** We take a step back from designing messages for richer communication. In this project, we iteratively [designed an application] for a mental health startup. [[project]](https://sleepypinks.github.io/koko)
